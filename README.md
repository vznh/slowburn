- **Git Aware**: <ins>splat</ins> takes into consideration your .gitignore files so that we won't use any sensitive info.
- **Highly Contextual**: You can use <ins>splat</ins> with a `-r` flag, grabbing all nodes to the Nth degree related to all error stack files in order to grab the most related content, delivering a highly accurate, optimized, and contextual debug response.

## Known Bugs
- <ins>splat</ins> will not conform to any formatting configurations when inserting code
- <ins>splat</ins> does not do well with running sub-module entrypoints that do not originate in the root directory
  
## Quick Start
You can use <ins>splat</ins> out of the box:  

`splat squash <?-r> <!entrypoint>`.

Just like you would enter your app, do so with <ins>splat</ins>.
